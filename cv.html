          Hi, my name is Patryk. I currently work as
          <b>ERP systems analyst</b> but as a new year resolution I've decided
          to learn coding. In the future I would like to progress in field of
          <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>cloud computing</strong>,
          <strong>cyber security</strong> or all of them at once &#x1f609;
          <br />I enjoy learning new skills, resolving technical issues and
          trying to work out how things work. I’m an <i>introvert</i> with good
          listening skills, lots of self-motivation and patience.
